<h2>About Dune: Imperium</h2>
<p>
Dune: Imperium is a competitive strategy game for 2-4 players set in
the iconic Dune universe created by Frank Herbert. Players take on the
roles of the noble Houses of the Imperium, vying for control of the
desert planet Arrakis, the only known source of the valuable spice
Melange.
</p>
<p>
The game combines elements of deckbuilding, worker placement, and area
control to create a unique and engaging experience. Players must
carefully manage their resources, forge alliances, and outmaneuver
their opponents to secure their victory.
